# LowEnergyFirmware
This is the repository for Internet of Things Embedded Firmware Class 2017. The primary goal of this class is to write low energy event driven firmware to extend the battery life of IoT devices.

**Objectives :** The following objectives are part of the coursework assignments

1. Setup Silicon Labs Blue Gecko for programming using Simplicity Studio
1. Use timers to setup a heartbeat indicator
1. Implement sleep routines for sleeping at different energy modes
1. Use an ADC and joystick to trigger multiple events
1. Implement SPI to communicate with the accelerometer and use it in lowest possible energy mode. Perform load power manangement on the accelerometer.
1. Implement I2C to communicate with a temperature humidity sensor. Perform load power manangement on the sensor.
